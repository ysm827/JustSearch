An autonomous AI deep-search agent powered by a self-hosted Chrome extension bridge, iterative task planning, deep web crawling, and cited multi-source synthesis.

## Overview

An autonomous AI deep-search agent powered by a self-hosted Chrome extension bridge, iterative task planning, deep web crawling, and cited multi-source synthesis. It drives your real, logged-in Chrome over a local WebSocket bridge — reusing your cookies/login state to bypass simple anti-bot defenses.

## Features

- Breaks search goals into iterative investigation steps.
- Drives your real Chrome via the browser bridge for deeper web access (login state reused, far fewer captchas than headless browsers).
- Synthesizes multi-source findings with citation traces.
- Provides Docker, helper scripts, and manual developer workflows.

## Quick Start

- Run `./run.sh` or `run.bat` to start the project.
- Load the self-hosted Chrome extension from `extension/` (see `extension/README.md`).
- For development, enter `backend` and install the Python dependencies from `backend/requirements.txt`.
- Docker users can use the included `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml`.

## Configuration

- Configure model, search, and browser bridge settings through backend environment variables.
- When captcha or anti-bot checks appear, follow the captcha guidance in the Chinese README.

## Tech Stack

- Python (FastAPI)
- Self-hosted Chrome extension bridge (MV3 + `chrome.debugger` CDP)
- Docker

## Project Structure
